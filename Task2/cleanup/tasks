For Questions 1 and 2 below, we are asking you to find, for each airport, the top 10 carriers and destination airports from that airport with respect to on-time departure performance. We are not asking you to rank the overall top 10 carriers/airports. For specific queries, see the Task 1 Queries and Task 2 Queries.

For each airport X, rank the top-10 carriers in decreasing order of on-time departure performance from X.
For each airport X, rank the top-10 airports in decreasing order of on-time departure performance from X.
For each source-destination pair X-Y, rank the top-10 carriers in decreasing order of on-time arrival performance at Y from X.
For each source-destination pair X-Y, determine the mean arrival delay (in minutes) for a flight from X to Y.
Group 3 (Answer both questions using Hadoop. You may also use Spark Streaming to answer Question 2.):

Does the popularity distribution of airports follow a Zipf distribution? If not, what distribution does it follow?
Tom wants to travel from airport X to airport Z. However, Tom also wants to stop at airport Y for some sightseeing on the way. More concretely, Tom has the following requirements (for specific queries, see the Task 1 Queries and Task 2 Queries):
a) The second leg of the journey (flight Y-Z) must depart two days after the first leg (flight X-Y). For example, if X-Y departs on January 5, 2008, Y-Z must depart on January 7, 2008.

b) Tom wants his flights scheduled to depart airport X before 12:00 PM local time and to depart airport Y after 12:00 PM local time.

c) Tom wants to arrive at each destination with as little delay as possible. You can assume you know the actual delay of each flight.

Your mission (should you choose to accept it!) is to find, for each X-Y-Z and day/month (dd/mm) combination in the year 2008, the two flights (X-Y and Y-Z) that satisfy constraints (a) and (b) and have the best individual performance with respect to constraint (c), if such flights exist.
